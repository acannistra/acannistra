### Hey! I'm Tony. 

I care about rigorously-derived methods for learning about, and taking good care of, our planet 🌍  .

I'm a geospatial software engineer at [onXmaps](https://onxmaps.com), where I'm working to build the best backcountry map for recreationists and professionals alike. 

I hold a Ph.D. 🎓  in Ecology from the University of Washington, where I developed a few new methodologies for understanding the effects of environmental change on ecosystems at a variety of scales, from organismal to planetary. I studied Computer Science at Tufts University in Medford, MA., where I earned my B.S. ([dissertation](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/45848) | [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F625TQUS-O-E8czmEw0tuxexZV3kcFjkpKqsxVgcoz-9tEP1c1eu9u7t35Mp7IbqH01mEHSns4YuO40yin6Xe7Bzb87_85K4mgevIJ5bRax-sHgag0&user=Qmp_x2MAAAAJ))

### Ask me about: 
* 🗺️ Geospatial software development in Python (and GDAL, and Mapbox, and QGIS, and PostGIS...)
* 🛰️ Remote sensing for environmental analysis (mostly Planet Labs, Landsat, Sentinel)
* 🌩️ Cloud-native data workflows (AWS ECS, Lambda, S3; COGs, STACs, and others.)
* ❓ Machine learning with heterogeneous environmental data (PyTorch, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn)
* 🌿  Ecological responses to climate change  
* ⚖️  Policy-forward solutions to the climate crisis
* ⛷️  Skiing/trail-running/recreating on U.S. Public Lands
